This file wraps the Agar.io Learning Environment (agarle)
in an OpenAI gym interface. The interface offers four different
kinds of observation types:

1. screen   - rendering of the agar.io game screen
              (only available if agarle was compiled with OpenGL)

2. grid     - an image-like grid with channels for pellets, cells, viruses, boundaries, etc.
              I recommend this one the most since it produces fixed-size image-like data
              is much faster than the "screen" type and doesn't require compiling with
              OpenGL (which works fine on my machine, but probably won't work on your machine LOL)

3. ram      - raw positions and velocities of every entity in a fixed-size vector
              I haven't tried this one, but I never got "full" to work, so I'm guessing
              that this is more difficult than "grid".

4. full     - positions and velocities of every entity in a variable length vector
              This is meant for debugging


This gym supports multiple agents in the same game. By default, there will
only be a single agent, and the gym will conform to the typical gym interface.
(note that there may still be any number of "bots" in this environment)

However, if you pass "multi_agent": True to the environment configuration
then the environment will have multiple agents all interacting within the
same agar.io game simultaneously.

    env = gym.make("agario-grid-v0", **{
        "multi_agent": True,
        "num_agents": 5
    })

In this setting, the environment object will no longer conform to the
typical gym interface in the following ways.

    1. `step()` will expect a list of actions of the same length
    as the number of agents.

    2. The return value of `step()` will be a list of observations,
    list of rewards, and list of dones each with length equal to
    the number of agents. The `info` dictionary (4th return value)
    remains a single dictionary.

    3. `reset()` will return a list of observations of length equal
    to the number of agents

    4. When an agent is "done", observations will be None. The environment
    may still be stepped while some agents are not done. Only when
    all agents are done must the environment be reset.

Note that if you pass "num_agents" greater than 1, "multi_agent"
will be set True automatically.
